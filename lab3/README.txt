1. In this lab I learned 2 different sorting methods, Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. Further, also learned the purpose of matrik and make file.  I compiled the code without any bugs.

2)
Insertion Sort
	SWAPS	COPY	COMPARISONS
BESTCASE	0	2n	n
WORSTCASE	n*n	2n	n*n
AVERAGECASE	n(n-1)	2n	n(n-1)

Merge Sort

 Merge sorting makes log (n)/2 (best) to log (n) (worst) comparisons and log(n) (best) to 1.5*log(n) (worst) swaps.
