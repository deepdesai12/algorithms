BREIF DESCRIPTION: 
--------------------------------------------------------
The things I achieved in the lab is the concept of tower Hanoi and how it can be solved using algorithm used in this program. Further, I also learned the importance of recursion and how merge sort works. Moreover, I learned the difference between stdout and stderr functions and prevent errors in the program. The knowledge of command line arguments was also achieved 
------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTIONS REQUIREMENT 1:

1. The first recursive call to towers will be: towers(4,2,1)
2. 31 moves will be made to towers()
3. 2 3
4 The second recursive call to tower will be: towers (3,2,3).
5 If the input was (8,1,2)
The number of moves will equal to (2^#ofdisk)-1. Therefore, (2^8)-1 = 255. So 255 lines will be printed out.
